[mod-description]
dupebox=Duplicate your production with Dupeboxes - multithreaded production buildings\n\n\nUsage:\n  - Use Dupebox Planner item to copy a design\n  - Plop down some copies of it\n  - place Dupebox Transfer Belts for input/output. Belts should be loaded with sane item on both sides of belt!\n  - Wait until bots build all ghosts\n  - Open train stop and press ACTIVATE button\n  - To build more things, go inside Dupebox and place some buildings or ghosts\nHow it works:\n    Mod takes N belts of same input and resuces them to 1 belt which goes into the box\n    Produced 1 belt of items is multiplied back to N belts of output\n    Mod uses pure combinator-based design you may see under dupebox, so it should be very UPS-efficient\nPower and liqued transfer is not done yet, you may use biolers or solar inside box for now
